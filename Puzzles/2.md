# Find the ages of daughters

Alok has three daughters. His friend Shyam wants to know the ages of his daughters. Alok gives him a first hint. 

1. The product of their age is 72. 
Shyam says this is not enough information. Alok gives him a second hint. 

2. The sum of their ages is equal to my house number. 
Shyam goes out and looks at the house number and says, “I still do not have enough information to determine the ages”. Alok admits that Shyam can not guess and gives him the third hint. 

3. The oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream. 
Shyam can guess after the third hint. Can you guess what are the ages of the three daughters?
