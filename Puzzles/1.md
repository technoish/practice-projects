# Measure 4 litre with 3 and 5 litre bottle
You have two bottles: one that can hold exactly 3 liters of water and another that can hold exactly 5 liters.

- Your goal is to measure out precisely 4 liters of water using only these two bottles, with no additional measuring devices or markings available on the bottles.
- You can fill the bottles to their full capacity, empty them completely, or pour water from one bottle to the other until one is full or the other is empty.
  
By relying solely on clever pouring strategies and logical thinking, how can you achieve exactly 4 liters of water in one of the bottles?

## Approach 1
 - 5 lt and 3 lt
 - 5 lt --> 5 lt and 3 lt --> 0
 - 5 lt --> 2 lt and 3 lt --> 3
 - 5 lt --> 2 lt and 3 lt --> 0
 - 5 lt --> 0 and 3 lt --> 2
 - 5 lt --> 5 lt and 3 lt --> 2
 - 5 lt --> 4 lt and 3 lt --> 3
  

## Approach 2
 - 5 lt and 3 lt
 - 5 lt --> 0 and 3 lt --> 3
 - 5 lt --> 3 and 3 lt --> 0
 - 5 lt --> 3 and 3 lt --> 3
 - 5 lt --> 5 and 3 lt --> 1
 - 5 lt --> 0 and 3 lt --> 1
 - 5 lt --> 1 and 3 lt --> 3
 - 5 lt --> 4 and 3 lt --> 0
